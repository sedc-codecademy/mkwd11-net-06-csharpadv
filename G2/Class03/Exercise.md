Make interface IEmployee, IDeveloper, ITester.

In IEmployee there should be a method that returns nothing and prints info.
IDeveloper and ITester must inherit the IEmployee interface.
IDeveloper has a method that returns a string Code().
ITester has a method that returns nothing, but it takes 1 argument that is number of bugs, the method name is Test(int numberOfBugs);

Make a Developer class and a Tester class, both have Create an abstract class Employee with the properties: FullName, Age, Enum with Roles.

Think of a solution now !!!
