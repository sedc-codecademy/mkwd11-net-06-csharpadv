// SOLID Principles
// SOLID is an acronym for five principles: 

// Single Responsibility Principle
// Open-Closed Principle
// Liskov Substitution Principle
// Interface Segregation Principle
// Dependency Inversion Principle

// These principles aim to promote modularity, flexibility, and maintainability in object - oriented design.



// DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)

// This principle emphasizes the elimination of code duplication.
// It suggests that code should have a single, authoritative source of truth, and any piece of knowledge or functionality should have a single, unambiguous representation in the codebase.



// KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

// The KISS principle advocates for simplicity in design and implementation.
// It suggests that code should be kept as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity and over - engineering.
// Simpler code tends to be easier to understand, debug, and maintain.



// YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

// YAGNI encourages developers to avoid adding functionality or features until they are actually needed.
// It advises against speculation and premature optimization, focusing instead on the current requirements and avoiding unnecessary complexity or bloat.
