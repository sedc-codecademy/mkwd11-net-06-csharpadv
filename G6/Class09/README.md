# Working with File System ðŸ¥¡

## C# and the File SystemðŸ”¹

The file system is the computer where the program we are running exists. Since back-end languages are used for building applications on the server-side, they should have no restrictions in manipulating the file system that they are running on for various tasks like writing data, reading data, performing changes to some configurations, working with documents, templates, etc. C# as a language can manipulate the file system by including a special namespace from the .NET framework called System.IO. This library has predefined classes and methods that can do things like moving files and folders, reading, writing, deleting, and creating new ones.

## Paths ðŸ”¹

If we want to work on the file system we have to know the exact place of the file or folder that we want to work with. For that, we must use paths to specify the address of that particular file or folder. That can be done in 2 ways:

* Absolute Path: A complete path to some location on the file system that does not rely on where your program is executed at the moment

```csharp
// An absolute path to a file in the folder of our C# console application
// NOTE: If we change or rename the folder location of our console application, this path will not work
string absolutePath = "C:\SEDC\CSharpAdv\FileSystem\FileSystem.App\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\file.txt";
// Absolute path to a file in the SEDC folder
string absoluteSedcPath = "C:\SEDC\file.txt";
```

* Relative Path:

```csharp
// A relative path to a file in the folder of our C# console application
// Since the program is already running from the folder path we don't need to write it with a relative path
// NOTE: If we change or rename the folder location of our console application, this path will still work
string relativePath = "file.txt";
// Relative path to a text file in the SEDC folder
string relativeSedcPath = "../../../../../file.txt"
```

## File and Directory ðŸ”¹

The System.IO namespace provides 2 very important static classes for helping us manipulate the file system. Those are File and Directory. These 2 static classes hold static methods which we can call and manipulate certain parts of the File System

### Directory

The directory static class provides us with methods for manipulating the directories on our computer ( Mainly the folders and folder structure ). This means that we can Create, Rename and Delete folders. We can also lookup directories and their locations ( Paths ) with this class as well. The main use for Directory is working with folders or finding out the path to something such as your current application that is running.

#### Current Directory

```csharp
string currentDirectory = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();
Console.WriteLine(currentDirectory);

// Relative path to our application folder
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
// Absolute path to our application folder
string appPath = @"C:\Users\MyPC\source\repos\SEDC.Adv08\SEDC.Adv08.FileSystem";
```

#### Check if a folder exists

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
// Using a variable to store the main app path for future use
bool myFolderExists = Directory.Exists(appPath + @"\myFolder");
// Using the whole address of the main app
bool myFolderExistsString = Directory.Exists(@"C:\Users\MyPC\source\repos\SEDC.Adv08\SEDC.Adv08.FileSystem\myFolder");
```

#### Create a new folder

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
// We create the path to the future folder that we want to create
// It should be in our main app folder and it should be called newFolder
string newFolder = appPath + @"\newFolder";
// We first check if it exists. If it does, we don't want to call the CreateDirectory method
if (!Directory.Exists(newFolder))
{
  // We create the new folder
  Directory.CreateDirectory(newFolder);
}
```

#### Delete a folder

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
// We add the path to the folder we want to delete
string newFolder = appPath + @"\newFolder";
// We check if the folder exists. If it does, we don't want to call the Delete method
if (Directory.Exists(newFolder))
{
  // We delete the new folder
  Directory.Delete(newFolder);
}
```

### File

The File static class is filled with static methods that help us manipulate files on the File System. Like the Directory, File works with paths to find out where and what we need to manipulate and can be used to do a lot of things with files such as read from files, write in them, create new files, delete, copy, etc. The file static class is usually used for reading data or writing data in a file, changing files properties, or just renaming or moving files in general.
> Note: One important thing about the File is that some actions like Create, make a connection to that file, and don't automatically close it. We must make sure that we close that connection when we are done, otherwise, our application will use the file even if we are not using it anymore, preventing us from doing things to the file in the future

#### Check if a file exists

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
string filesPath = appPath + @"\myFolder";
bool testTxtExists = File.Exists(filesPath + @"test.txt");
```

#### Create a file

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
string filesPath = appPath + @"\myFolder";
if (!File.Exists(filesPath + @"test.txt"))
{
  // We create the file and close the connection
  File.Create(filesPath + @"test.txt").Close();
}
```

#### Delete a file

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
string filesPath = appPath + @"\myFolder";
if (File.Exists(filesPath + @"\test.txt"))
{
  File.Delete(filesPath + @"\test.txt");
}
Console.ReadLine();
```

#### Write in a file

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
string filesPath = appPath + @"\myFolder";
if (File.Exists(testTxtPath))
{
    File.WriteAllText(testTxtPath, "Hello SEDC! We are writing in a file");
}
```

#### Read from a file

```csharp
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
string filesPath = appPath + @"\myFolder";
if (File.Exists(testTxtPath))
{
    string content = File.ReadAllText(testTxtPath);
}
```

## Reading and Writing with streams ðŸ”¹

File is great for working with any type of file. But if we have a lot of work with files that consist of text, then StreamWriter and StreamReader are the way to go. With these two Classes, we can easily manipulate with text in a file in a bulk, with multiple actions and commands at once, without worrying that we are going to lock the file with the many actions. They both create a stream of data to the file and that stream makes it possible for us to do multiple stuff consecutively. When we are done the stream needs to be closed, but we can use the class itself to wrap it in a code block so the stream can be closed automatically. Like the other classes that work with the file system, we must have a defined path to the file that we want to use.

### StreamWriter

```csharp
 // Writing with StreamWriter
string appPath = @"..\..\..\";
string folderPath = appPath + @"myFolder\";
string filePath = folderPath + @"test.txt";
if (!Directory.Exists(folderPath))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(folderPath);
    Console.WriteLine("New directory was created!");
}
// Writing with StreamWriter
using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(streamTestPath))
{
    sw.WriteLine("Hello SEDC!");
    sw.WriteLine("We are writing text from StreamWriter!");
    Console.WriteLine("Writing is complete!");
}

// Writing without rewriting the document with StreamWriter
using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(streamTestPath, true))
{
    sw.WriteLine("Hello AGAIN!");
    sw.WriteLine("This is written on top of the previous one!");
    Console.WriteLine("Writing again!");
}
Console.ReadLine();
```

### StreamReader

```csharp
using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(filePath))
{
    string firstLine = sr.ReadLine();
    string secondLine = sr.ReadLine();
    string restContent = sr.ReadToEnd();
    Console.WriteLine($"First Line:{firstLine}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Second Line:{secondLine}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Rest of content:{restContent}");
}
```
